# Push to GitHub Instructions

Since I cannot directly authenticate with your GitHub account, please follow these steps to push all the changes to your repository:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest)

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Add this repository if not already added: `/mnt/c/Users/zakia/CHTNEW`
3. You should see all the changes listed
4. Write a commit message (or use the one below)
5. Click "Commit to main"
6. Click "Push origin"

## Option 2: Using Command Line

Open Git Bash or Terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
# Check status (optional)
git status

# The changes are already committed, so just push:
git push origin main
```

If prompted for credentials, use your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (not password).

## Option 3: Using VS Code

1. Open VS Code in the project directory
2. Go to Source Control tab (Ctrl+Shift+G)
